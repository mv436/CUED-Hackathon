# CUED-Hackthon

Under a time target of 24 hours, the goal of the hackathon was to produce 
a project using  an ARM microprocessor, which incorporated multiple sensors 
such as light, distance, temperature etc. As a team of five we decided to use 
the microprocessor, to measure the number of people in the room, temperature, 
humidity and air quality and send that to a local HTTP Python Server from which 
the data can be collected on the server. Then we created a website that uploads 
the data continuously from the server and plots graphs of the different 
parameters of the room.
